                    <p>
                        Each player puts 3-5 nouns in the bowl.</p>

                    <h4>Guess the words</h4>


                    <p>
                        The game consists of 3 rounds. In each round, teams take turns
                        appointing a cluemeister to help them guess words. The cluemeister
                        draws nouns from the bowl and attempts to get the rest of their team
                        to guess as many nouns as possible in a limited time. When the bowl
                        is empty, the round is over.
          </p>

                            The cluemeister can say anything they want to help their teammates
                            guess the clue. They can't spell the word or rhyme it.

                    <h3>Giving up</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can't "pass" on a word. If the cluemeister gives up, the team's turn
                        is over.
          </p>
                    <h3>Leftover time</h3>
                    <p>
                        If a team ends a round with time still on the clock, that team
                        begins the next round with a shortened turn. Their remaining time
                        carries over to the next round.
          </p>
                    <h3>Scoring</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each correctly guessed noun is worth 1 point. The game corrects for
                        any unfairness in case one team got more play time than other teams.
