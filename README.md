# Bowl Full of Nouns

It's 2020. You're stuck inside. You miss your family.

We can fix one of these problems.

To serve: `cd web; npm start`


## TODO
* don't allow super long words (done)
* words illegible on mobile safari, need to wrap down
* explain that there is "pending time" and the same person should continue (done)
* seems to be a bug where sometimes a new word isn't generated (something something state) (maybe fixed?)
* length limits for words, teams (done)

Minor
* redirect "/game" to index
* margins on round 0 interstitial (for non-admin)
* add word styled funny on mobile safari
* "add team" link in the menu for admin in round 0 (done)
* example word in round 1 interstitial is missing font
* at the end, show the whole word list
* limits for team and word count.
* Edit team names

### Someday
* Statistics around which words take long
* words that have large differential between rounds
